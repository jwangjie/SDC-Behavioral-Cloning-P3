### Overview

The goal of the behavioral cloning project is to train a CNN to drive autonomously in a simulator. The project is a simulation implementation of the "End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars" [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf) by NVIDIA. The CNN implemented in the project is differnet to the one in the paper, more details are explained [here](https://github.com/jwangjie/SDC-Behavioral-Cloning-P3/blob/master/Behavioral%20Cloning.pdf).

### The steps of the project:

* Use the [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
